You still have to respect a woman that you married she might be here. Everything be thankful for what you have. She will be your only one in the end. Hopefully you have a strong relationship.
Someone is sleeping on the couch
Keep that energy
Its his patriotic duty not to do the dishes and if his wife forces him, then she's obviously committing treason .
hope bro is still alive !😮
No sadly ,terrible accident in the waste disposal

If dishwashing is a sport then you're a very combative person. What's so wrong with washing the dishes? Is it below your standing in the relationship or are you some male Alpha?
Why do u look like the undertaker? Are u his brother or wot?
Ladies just don't give him he's food on dishes but on crap paper see how he likes it then because it's crap he's talking dishes ain't a woman's sport it's a household family chore...

And that’s why I never do the dishes 🤣
I always do the dishes so I know it’s done right:, I cook and clean you sit back and be pretty.
Just a reason why women are stronger and more mature, js shows the disrespect towards women
I just turned my dishwasher into a snow blower … I gave her a shovel 😁😆😆
Good one

Idk if this Undertaker or Stone Cold
Our little comedian ahh reel🥀
Hahaha! Bam
Love this guy
Great video.
I can't stop laughing 😆,! That was hilarious!
RIP 😂😂😂
You shouldn't be doing dishes to start with
Real Talk 💯
I actually do that in a much better and complete way: only a few women can compete in such a field, like in ant of the fields where we decide to engage…and that is a fact. Only in 1 and only one they are by far outpacing, with an unbridgeable gap (when they are in the mood) and let me just give you a metaphoric hint: “lupara” vs “m134” 😅🤣
Oh yeah 😂❤️❤️
That’s pretty good joke .
Jajaja
And when is his viewing and funeral?
You're the Undertaker, you can give her the Tombstone when she doesn't do the dishes. 🙌
He didn't live to see the next day
And who made washing dishes a women's sport? Was he not washing those dishes before he got married if was not with his parents? Lazy mind 😂😂
Undertaker?
That’s funny
The Undertaker is retired. But he still remains my favorite character. He is a class act which nobody can beat. He still is master of entertainment. Every line is well thought out. He could return to the ring and defeat all challenges.
@realdonaldtrump after seeing this!
sleeping on the couch tonight 🤣
Run, as fast as you can don't stop don't look back
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha very good very good

Man is a beast 🤣🤣🤣
My mother sent me this. I have no idea what to think
😂😂 I HOPE HE IS STILL ALIVE 🤣👍
Oh that’s not …. I don’t find this funny at all actually find this offensive because you’re killing me, only woman can do dishes or work in the kitchen like that’s not …
Did Trump need to make it illegal for men that do not have enough money to provide for the woman they want to cook and clean and wash dishes that they make sure that they have enough money to buy them a dishwasher and a personal housekeeper and a personal chef because if you can’t afford it, you can’t get it!!!!

Try living alone Bubby. Seems that's where you are headed. You are going to s
@dono839golf discover after coming home from a hard day at work, that the o ly way you are going to get a hot meal is fixing it for yourself. You want a cup of coffee? Go fix it your self. The doing dishes thing? You will quickly learn to just to eat out of the pan. No dishes to wash, just one pan and one utensil. Adapt, compensate and overcome!
I thought the human brain matures after the age of 40🙏💀
Ummm... what abt the "women" (trans men) in men's sports?? Ain't cis men got a advantage over "her"?
Nooooooo 🤣🤣🤣
ZING 🔥🙌👏🤣👍👍👍👍👏

Savage, Lol!!!
It’s not a sport it’s more like a hobby
A joke of course. Personally I always like washing dishes or should I say playing with water. 🙃
Everytime anyone prefaces what they are about to say with “trump made it” you absolutely know they are talking out their ass.

Yep🤣
I never knew washing dirty dishes was a sport I told that to my loving wife & she said if don’t clean those dirty dishes you won’t be playing any type of sports because I’ll make sure you wouldn’t be able to walk & I said that was funny & started washing the dirty dishes
Awesome Im using that 1 tonight
Hell yeah🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lol that's funny, but dishes isn't a sport, household cores. Lol video is a good one 👍
Lol!!
finally a good law that’s fair
You guys bring home the money and do the dishes? Hahahaha ain't happening. That's the problem with females. Relationships need to be 50/50. Not 70/30.
Washing dish is not women’s job

Yay for sexism and chauvinist @stonerchick6420 #metalheadsoulmate
Trumppp 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hes not wrong
Savage shit,🤣🤣🤣💯🥊
Good one😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love it I have to remember that one❤️👏 didn’t never thought that men had have to come home and do the dishes do their laundry, cook their dinner and pay all the bills after a hard day work that’s what you get married for. That’s what a woman is supposed to do take care of the household duties and maybe get our allowance if she’s a good girl at the end of the week to go buy her candy bar or something that she’d want, no more than maybe a $20 allowance that’s plenty of money you keep controlling your money never give it to the woman and never let them know how much you make it really not their business
I can't breathe.
Stone Cold Steve Austin has aged! 😂😂😂😂
Check out.
